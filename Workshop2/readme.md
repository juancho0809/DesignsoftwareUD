## Workshop 2 

appreciate the work, I'm improving the repo :)
- Clase UML (1) (Test about the diagram class using design patterns)
- Taller2.py (Test about the code applying the diagram class)

You need to deliver a new version, improving anything

### Requirements

- Cars must have next attributes: transmission, chassis, year, trade, model, combustible
type, and engine.
-  Yacht must have next attributes: length, weight, year, trade, model, engine.
-  Trucks and Motorcycles will keep same attributes as before. However, just for trucks
you need to calculate the gas consumption due to regulations of both USA and Europe.
- You need to add next vehicles options, and you must define the appropriate atteibutes
they need: Helicopter, Scooter.
- Create engines in the platform is not a good idea due to possible human errors. So, it is a better idea to have some predefined engines per each one of the vehicles types, divider in gas and electric engines. Also, per each vehicle you should define low gama and high gama engine.

- All engines must have next attributes: stability, power, weight, dimensions, torque,
and maximum speed.
- You must reduce memory as much as possible, so check where you could reduce the
creation of duplicates objects to avoid. Be careful with memory references.

### Things to take account and Pending Things

- First make the technical inform and the diagram class, don't waste time trying code without a goal stablished
- In class i don't create the technical, just the "code" and the diagram class using abstract factory and singleton
