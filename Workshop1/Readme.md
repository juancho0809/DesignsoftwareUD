You have been hird by a veehicle constructor company, we don't know how but that happens. You are on charge to create a new internal platform to define a catalog of vehicle

Requeriments are described as follows:

- Each vehicle has at least engine, chasis (A o B), model, gas consumption, and year. Depending on the vehicle type, you should define additional properties

- There are differente vehicle types(for now): car, truck, yacht and motorcycle

- Each engine has at least name, type of engine, potency and weight

- To calculate the vehicle gas consumption you could create a method based on: 1.1 * engine.potency + 0.2 * engine.weight - (0.3 if A or 0.5 if B)
